ðŸ§© Styling Approach

1. CSS Methodology

The styling follows a modular CSS structure using clean and meaningful class names.
Optional BEM conventions (.form_group, .formlabel, .form_input) are used for readability and maintainability.

2. File Structure

project-folder/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css
â””â”€â”€ README.md

index.html â€” Contains the structured form markup.

styles.css â€” Holds all the external styling, organized by section.

README.md â€” Documentation for implementation and design decisions.


3. CSS Structure

The styles.css file is organized as follows:

/* 1. CSS Reset / Normalize */
/* 2. CSS Variables (Colors, Font Sizes) */
/* 3. Global Styles (Typography, Body) */
/* 4. Layout (Form Container) */
/* 5. Form Elements (Inputs, Labels, Fieldsets) */
/* 6. Buttons (Submit, Reset) */
/* 7. States (Hover, Focus, Active, Disabled) */
/* 8. Responsive Media Queries */
